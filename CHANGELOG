### Added
 
### Changed
  
- Modified debug flags on command line. Now defaults and file logging are similar to
  the one on the provided skeleton. Command line flags have been updated accordingly.

  (adding server IP address and port on message).

- Added server default address (127.0.0.1) on client if not provided on command line.

- Added retry loop for connecting to server on client if client cannot connect on startup.

- Better messages and handling on client SETUP on non 200 status. Now shows the error 
  message on screen.

### Fixed

  Teardown message.
